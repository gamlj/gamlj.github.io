Polinomial effects for continuous variables can be added to the model. When a variable is selected in the `r opt("Components")` field, a little number appears on the right side of the selection. The number indicates the _order_ of the effect.

By increasing that number before dragging the term into the `r opt("Model Terms")` field, one can include any high order effect.

Increasing the order number and combining the selection with other variables allows including interactions involving higher order effects of a variable.
