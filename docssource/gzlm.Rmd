**Generalized Linear Models** module of the GAMLj suite for jamovi

`r version("1.6.0")` 

<img src="gzlm/main.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">

The module estimates generalized linear models with categorial and/or continuous  dependent and independent variables, with options to facilitate estimation ofinteractions, simple slopes, simple effects, etc.

# Module
The module can estimate several linear models:

* Linear model
* Poisson model
* Poisson overdispersed
* Negative binomial model
* Logistic model
* Probit model
* Multinomial model
* Custom model with combinations of distribution and link function

For each model, any combination of categorical and continuous variables can be set as independent variables, thus providing an easy way for multiple regression, ANOVA-like, ANCOVA-like and moderation analysis for categorical and count dependent variables. 

Models are defined by a link function (LF) and the dependent variable distribution, thus allowing to model different types of dependent variables:

* `r opt("Linear")` model: identity LF, gaussian distribution, yielding a general linear model for continuous dependent variables.
* `r opt("Poisson")` model: logarithm LF, Poisson distribution, modelling count dependent variables. This model is often called log-linear model when the independent variables are all categorical.
* `r opt("Poisson (overdispersion)")` model: Overdispersed Poisson model: logarithm LF, Poisson distribution, quasi-maximum likelihood estimation, with overdispersion, modelling count dependent variables. This model is often used for overdispersed data.
* `r opt("Negative binomial")` model: logarithm LF, negative binomial distribution, maximum likelihood estimation, with overdispersion, modelling count dependent variables. This model is often used for overdispersed data.

* `r opt("Logistic")` model: logit LF, binomial distribution, modelling dichotomous dependent variables.
* `r opt("Probit")` model: inverse of the cumulative normal distribution link function, binomial distribution, modelling dichotomous dependent variables.

* `r opt("Multinomial")` model: logit LF, multinomial distribution, modelling categorical dependent variables. 

* `r opt("Custom")` model: combination of distribution family and link function. 
    
    - The available distributions are:

        - Gaussian
        - Binomial
        - Gamma
        - Inverse Gaussian

    - The available link functions are:
        - Identity
        - Log
        - Inverse
        - Inverse squared

The plausibility of the distribution/link function combination is no checked, but errors are issued if the data do not conform to the chosen custom model. 

# Estimates
The module provides Analysis of Deviance tables and parameter estimates for any estimated model. Variables definition follows jamovi standards, with categorical independent variables defined in "factors" and continuous independent variables in "covariates".

Effect size indexes are optionally computed by selecting `Odd rations (expB)`. Odd ratios apply the exponential function to the parameter estimates, thus they make sense in all models where the link function is based on the logarithm.`Relative risk (RR)` indexes can be obtained for logistic models.

# Model 

By default, the model terms are filled in automatically for main effects and for interactions with categorical variables.

Interactions between continuous variables or categorical and continuous ones can be set by selecting one or more variables and clicking the second arrow icon.

```{r child1, child='commons/nonlinear_chunk.Rmd'}
```


The option `r opt("Fixed Intercept")` includes an intercept in the model. Unflag it to estimate zero-intercept models (Regression through the origin, but see [here](https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2017/04/13/dont-force-your-regression-through-zero-just-because-you-know-the-true-intercept-has-to-be-zero/) before you do it ).

# Covariates Scaling
<img src="commons/pics/xscoring.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">

Continuous variables can be centered, standardized (`r opt("z-scores")`), log-transformed (`r opt("Log")`) or used as they are (`r opt("none")`). The default is `r opt("centered")` because it makes our lives much easier when there are interactions in the model, and do not affect the B coefficients when there are none. Thus, if one is comparing results with other software that does not center the continuous variables, without interactions in the model one would find only a discrepancy in the intercept, because in GAMLj the intercept represents the expected value of the dependent variable for the average value of the independent variable. If one needs to _unscale_ the variable, simply select `r opt("none")`.

# Plots

Plots interpretation varies depending on the model being estimated. All plots are, however, depicting predicted values in the response original scale (usually probabilities). See details and interpretation discussion.
