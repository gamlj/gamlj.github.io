**Generalized Linear Models** module of the GAMLj suite for jamovi

`r version("1.6.0")` 

`r pic("gzlm/main.png")`

The module estimates generalized linear models with categorial and/or continuous  dependent and independent variables, with options to facilitate estimation ofinteractions, simple slopes, simple effects, etc.

# Module
The module can estimate several linear models:

* Linear model
* Poisson model
* Poisson overdispersed
* Negative binomial model
* Logistic model
* Probit model
* Ordinal model (proportional odds)
* Multinomial model
* Custom model with combinations of distribution and link function


Models are defined by a link function (LF) and the dependent variable distribution, thus allowing to model different types of dependent variables:

* `r opt("Linear")` model: identity LF, gaussian distribution, yielding a general linear model for continuous dependent variables.
* `r opt("Poisson")` model: logarithm LF, Poisson distribution, modelling count dependent variables. This model is often called log-linear model when the independent variables are all categorical.
* `r opt("Poisson (overdispersion)")` model: Overdispersed Poisson model: logarithm LF, Poisson distribution, quasi-maximum likelihood estimation, with overdispersion, modelling count dependent variables. This model is often used for overdispersed data.
* `r opt("Negative binomial")` model: logarithm LF, negative binomial distribution, maximum likelihood estimation, with overdispersion, modelling count dependent variables. This model is often used for overdispersed data.

* `r opt("Logistic")` model: logit LF, binomial distribution, modelling dichotomous dependent variables.
* `r opt("Probit")` model: inverse of the cumulative normal distribution link function, binomial distribution, modelling dichotomous dependent variables.

* `r opt("Ordinal")` model: s proportional odds logistic regression, cumlative logit LF, multinomial distribution, modelling ordered dependent variables. 

* `r opt("Multinomial")` model: logit LF, multinomial distribution, modelling categorical dependent variables. 

* `r opt("Custom")` model: combination of distribution family and link function. 
    
    - The available distributions are:

        - Gaussian
        - Binomial
        - Gamma
        - Inverse Gaussian

    - The available link functions are:
        - Identity
        - Log
        - Inverse
        - Inverse squared

The plausibility of the distribution/link function combination is no checked, but errors are issued if the data do not conform to the chosen custom model.

For each model, any combination of categorical and continuous variables can be set as independent variables, thus providing an easy way for multiple regression, ANOVA-like, ANCOVA-like and moderation analysis for categorical and count dependent variables. An `r opt("Offset")` variable can be defined, which is included in the model with a fixed coefficient (set to 1) (see `r link_pages("gzlm_offset")`)

The options of this panel are:

`r panel_options('gamljglm','panel_input')`



# Model 

By default, the model terms are filled in automatically for main effects and for interactions with categorical variables.

Interactions between continuous variables or categorical and continuous ones can be set by selecting one or more variables and clicking the second arrow icon.

```{r child1, child='commons/nonlinear_chunk.Rmd'}
```


```{r , child='commons/fixedcomparison_chunk.Rmd'}
```


The options are:

`r panel_options('gamljglm','panel_model')`


# Factors coding

```{r child2, child='commons/factorCoding_chunk.Rmd'}
```

# Covariates Scaling

Continuous variables can be centered, standardized (`r opt("z-scores")`), log-transformed (`r opt("Log")`) or used as they are (`r opt("none")`). The default is `r opt("centered")` because it makes our lives much easier when there are interactions in the model, and do not affect the B coefficients when there are none. Thus, if one is comparing results with other software that does not center the continuous variables, without interactions in the model one would find only a discrepancy in the intercept, because in GAMLj the intercept represents the expected value of the dependent variable for the average value of the independent variable. If one needs to _unscale_ the variable, simply select `r opt("none")`.


```{r child3, child='commons/covariateScaling_chunk.Rmd'}
```

```



# Plots

`r pic("gzlm/plot.png")`


```{r child5, child='commons/plots_chunk.Rmd'}
```

Plots interpretation varies depending on the model being estimated. All plots are, however, depicting predicted values in the response original scale  (usually probabilities). See details and interpretation discussion.

The options are:

`r panel_options('gamljglm','panel_plots')`

# Simple Effects


```{r child60, child='commons/se_chunk.Rmd'}
```


# Estimated marginal means
