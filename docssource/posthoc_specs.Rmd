# Post Hocs

Post-hocs tests are performed as implemented in the [emmeans package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/emmeans/index.html). In particular, the actual implementation is as follows (for any given model term selected by the user) :

```
      formula <- as.formula(paste('~', term))
      referenceGrid <- emmeans::emmeans(private$.model, formula)
      bonferroni <- summary(pairs(referenceGrid, adjust='bonferroni'))
      holm <- summary(pairs(referenceGrid, adjust='holm'))
      tukey<-summary(pairs(referenceGrid, adjust='tukey'))
```

In `Mixed` module only `bonferroni` and `holm` methods are implemented yet, because I did not find enough evidence in the literature in support of other methods.
