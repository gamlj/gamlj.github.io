# First versions

#  version 1.0.5 

* polynomial effects
* Update graphs when model terms are changed
* Fix the R-squared for not binomial GZLM 
* added datasets

#  version 1.0.4 

* Fix bug in simple effects display in Windows 10
* Fix simple effects for "dummy" coded factors

#  version 1.0.3 
* add R interface command to obtain a ggplot object
* fix some characters in Windows

#  version 1.0.1 

## Common

* bug fix regarding recycling results with very large datasets
* Estimated marginal means for conditioned covariates
* contrasts labels in the simple effects parameters table
* contrasts labels in the plots
* custom levels for conditioning of continuous variables involved in interactions
* labels or values in simple effects tables and plots for continuous covariates
* fix interaction disappearing from model declaration
* fix variables name with spaces and weired characters 
* Improved description of contrast coding
* add dummy coding (0 and 1) with intercept equal to reference group
* Fix interaction symbol in windows 10
* Restructuring of simple effects and posthoc table for better reading
* Improved compatibility with R when loaded as R package
* Helper functions to interact with the results in R
* Recycle of table results to speed up results updating
* Fix for factor levels labels with spaces and other weired characters
* Fix for variable names with spaces and other weired characters
* Improved plots

## Mixed models


* Intra-class correlation for random intercepts
* Random effects plots
* LRT for random effects
* Fix for models without fixed intercept
* Fix for random intercept only models 
* Wider range of estimation techniques when model does not converge at first run
* Improved warnings and comments
* More flexible estimation of simple effects

## GLM models

* Added Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests for normality of residuals
* Added Adjusted R-squared

## GLZM models

* Several small bug fixes
* Improved info table regarding model implementation

#  version 0.9.7 

* fix cluster-based centering and standardizing

#  version 0.9.6 

* Fix multinomial plot axes


#  version 0.9.4 

## New features

* Probit model
* Over-dispersed Poisson model
* Negative binomial model

## Bug fixes

* Plot without confidence intervals 
* Contrasts coding in line wiht ANOVA module

  
#  version 0.9.3 


* Plotting raw data along with predicted effects

* Y-axis range can be set to the range of the dependent variable 

* Confidence intervals for all models in the plots

* Catching several errors with degenerated or non-estimable multinomial models

  

#  version 0.9.2 


* Fixed a bug in the GZLM R-squared. Now the R-squared corresponds to McFadden’s R squared [ref info](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/faq/general/faq-what-are-pseudo-r-squareds/)

* Fix errors with  non-standard names of variables

* Better warnings when emmeans fails to estimate the post-hocs in GZLM

* Labels in multinomial plots for separate lines variable

* Uncorrelated random effects option now works

# version 0.0.9

* First release to go public
