**General Linear Model** module of the GAMLj suite for jamovi

`r version("1.5.0")` 

<img src="glm/main.png  " class="img-responsive" alt="">

The module estimates a general linear model with categorial and/or continuous variables, with options to facilitate estimation ofinteractions, simple slopes, simple effects, etc.

# Module
The module can estimate OLS linear models for any combination of categorical and continuous variables, thus providing an easy way for multiple regression, ANOVA, ANCOVA and moderation analysis. 

# Estimates
The module provides ANOVA tables and parameters estimates for any estimated model. Effect size indices (eta, omega, and beta) are optionally computed.

Variables definition follows jamovi standards, with categorical independent variables defined in "factors" and continuous independent variables in "covariates".

Effect size indices are optionally computed by selecting the following options:

  - __beta__ : standardized regression coefficients. Continuous variables are standardized and categorical ones are contrast coded (-1 0 1) before estimating the parameters.
  - __eta^2__: "semi-partial" eta-squared computed as the sum-of-squares of the effect divided by the total sum-of-square.
  - partial __eta^2__: partial eta-squared computed as the sum-of-squares of the effect divided by the  sum-of-squares of the effect plus the sum-of-squares of error.
  - __omega^2__: omega-squared 

Confidence intervals of the parameters can be also selected.

# Model 

By default, the model terms are filled in automatically for main effects and for interactions with categorical variables.

Interactions between continuous variables or categorical and continuous variables can be set by clicking the second arrow icon.

```{Call_child, child='commons/nonlinear_chunk.Rmd'}
```


The option `Fixed Intercept` includes an intercept in the model. Unflag it to estimate zero-intercept models (Regression through the origin, but see [here](https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2017/04/13/dont-force-your-regression-through-zero-just-because-you-know-the-true-intercept-has-to-be-zero/) before you do it ).

# Covariates Scaling
<img src="commons/pics/xscoring.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">

Continuous variables can be centered, standardized or used as they are (`none`). The default is `centered` because it makes our lives much easier when there are interactions in the model, and do not affect the B coefficients when there are none. Thus, if one is comparing results with other software that does not center the continuous variables, without interactions in the model one would find only a discrepancy in the intercept, because in GAMLj the intercept represents the expected value of the dependent variable for the average value of the independent variable. If one needs to _unscale_ the variable, simply select `none`.

* `Homogeneity tests` provides [Levene's test](https://biostats.w.uib.no/test-for-homogeneity-of-variances-levenes-test/){target="_blank"} for equal variances across groups defined by factors  (homoschedasticity).

* `Normality of residuals` provides [Klomogorov-Smirnov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test){target="_blank"} and [Shapiro-Wilk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro%E2%80%93Wilk_test#Interpretation){target="_blank"} tests for normality of residuals.

* `Q-Q` plot outputs a Q-Q plot (observed residual quantiles on expected residual quantiles). More general info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q%E2%80%93Q_plot){target="_blank"}
