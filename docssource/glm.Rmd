**General Linear Model** module of the GAMLj suite for jamovi

`r version("3.0.0")` 

`r pic("glm/main.png")`

The module estimates a general linear model with categorical and/or continuous variables, with options to facilitate estimation of interactions, simple slopes, simple effects, etc.

The module can estimate OLS linear models for any combination of categorical and continuous variables, thus providing an easy way for multiple regression, ANOVA, ANCOVA and moderation analysis. 

# Estimates
The module provides ANOVA tables and parameters estimates for any estimated model. Variance-based effect size indices (eta, partial eta, partial omega, partial epsilon, and beta) and mean comparisons (Cohen's d) are optionally computed.

Variables definition follows `r jamovi` standards, with categorical independent variables defined in `r opt("Factors")` and continuous independent variables in `r opt("Covariates")`.

 `r pic("glm/variables.png")`
 
Effect size indices are optionally computed by selecting the following options (see  `r link_pages("details_glm_effectsize")`):

  - $\beta$ : standardized regression coefficients
  - $\eta^2$: (semi-partial) eta-squared 
  - $\eta^2$p : partial eta-squared
  - $\omega^2$ : omega-squared 
  - $\omega^2$p : partial omega-squared 
  - $\epsilon^2$ :  epsilon-squared 
  - $\epsilon^2$p : partial epsilon-squared 


Confidence intervals of the parameters can be also selected in `r opt("Options")` tab (see below).


Please check the details in `r link_pages(nickname="details_glm_effectsize")`

The complete set of options for this panel is:

`r panel_options('gamljlm','panel_input')`


# Model 

By default, the model terms are filled in automatically for main effects and for interactions with categorical variables. 

`r pic("glm/model.png")`

Interactions between continuous variables or categorical and continuous variables can be set by clicking the second arrow icon.

```{r child1, child='commons/nonlinear_chunk.Rmd'}
```


The option `r opt("Intercept")` includes an intercept in the model. Unflagging it estimates zero-intercept models (Regression through the origin, but see [here](https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2017/04/13/dont-force-your-regression-through-zero-just-because-you-know-the-true-intercept-has-to-be-zero/) before you do it ). 



```{r , child='commons/fixedcomparison_chunk.Rmd'}
```


The other options are:

`r panel_options('gamljlm','panel_model')`

# Factors coding

More details and examples `r link_pages("ros_contrasts")`.


# Covariates Scaling

`r pic("glm/xscoring.png")`

Continuous variables can be `r opt("Centered")`, standardized (`r opt("z-scores")`), log-transformed (`r opt("Log")`) or used as they are (`r opt("none")`). The default is `r opt("centered")` because it makes our lives much easier when there are interactions in the model, and do not affect the B coefficients when there are none. Thus, if one is comparing results with other software that does not center the continuous variables, without interactions in the model one would find only a discrepancy in the intercept, because in `r modulename()` the intercept represents the expected value of the dependent variable for the average value of the independent variable. If one needs to _unscale_ the variable, simply select `r opt("none")`.


```{r child3, child='commons/covariateScaling_chunk.Rmd'}
```

The option `r opt("Dependent variable")`  scale allows to transform the dependent variable. The dependent variable can be centered, standardized (`r opt("z-scores")`), log-transformed (`r opt("Log")`) or used as it is (`r opt("none")`). The default is `r opt("none")`, so no transformation is applied.

Along with the means comparisons, one can obtain also the Cohen's $d$ effect size indices. Different formulation of the Cohen's $d$ are available, and they differ in the way the pooled standard error is computed.

* Cohen's d (model SD) $d_{mod}$: the means difference is divided by the estimated standard deviation computed based on the model residual variance. 

* Cohen's d (sample SD) $d_{sample}$: the means difference is divided by the pooled standard deviation computed within each group. 

* Hedge's g  $g_{sample}$: the means difference is divided by the pooled standard deviation computed within each group, corrected for sample bias. The correction is the one describe by @hedges2014statistical based on the Gamma function.
