<img src="commons/pics/simple.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">

Simple effects can be computed for any combination of types of variables, 
making it easy to proble interaction, simple slopes, and combinations of them. Simple effects can estimated  up to a three-way interaction.

Simple effects are computed following the same logic of the plots. They correspond to the plotted effects as defined above. As for plots, the effects are estimated for different levels of the categorical moderators and for the conditioning values of the continuous moderators defined in `r opt("Covariates Scaling")` panel.
