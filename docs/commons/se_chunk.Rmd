Simple effects can be computed for any combination of types of variables, 
making it easy to probe interactions, simple slopes, and combinations of them. Simple effects can estimated  up to any order of interaction. If only one moderator is set in the `r opt("Moderators")` field, the effect of the variable in the `r opt("Simple effects variable")` is computed at different levels of the moderator. If more than one moderator is defined, the effects are estimated for all combinations of the moderator levels. 

Simple effects are computed following the same logic of the plots. They correspond to the plotted effects as defined above. As for plots, the effects are estimated for different levels of the categorical moderators and for the conditioning values of the continuous moderators defined in `r opt("Covariates Scaling")` panel.

When there is more than one moderator, one can activate `r opt("Simple interactions")` to obtain estimation and tests for lower order interactions at different levels of a moderator. Simple interactions are computed using the last variable appearing in the `r opt("Moderators")` field as moderator. In the case depicted in the figure above, the interaction `w*x` is estimated and tested at different levels of `z`.
