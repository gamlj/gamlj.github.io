ABSTRACT={The validity of inferences drawn from statistical test results depends on how well data meet associated assumptions. Yet, research (e.g., Hoekstra et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2012</xref>) indicates that such assumptions are rarely reported in literature and that some researchers might be unfamiliar with the techniques and remedies that are pertinent to the statistical tests they conduct. This article seeks to support researchers by concisely reviewing key statistical assumptions associated with substantive statistical tests across the general linear model. Additionally, the article reviews techniques to check for statistical assumptions and identifies remedies and problems if data do not meet the necessary assumptions.}

abstract = {Summary Nakagawa \& Schielzeth extended the widely used goodness-of-fit statistic R2 to apply to generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). However, their R2GLMM method is restricted to models with the simplest random effects structure, known as random intercepts models. It is not applicable to another common random effects structure, random slopes models. I show that R2GLMM can be extended to random slopes models using a simple formula that is straightforward to implement in statistical software. This extension substantially widens the potential application of R2GLMM.},
